🐍 Python Learning Projects

Welcome to my Python folder! 👋

This repository contains a collection of small Python scripts and experiments I've been working on as I learn the language. These are just some of my first tries with Python — I'm exploring, practicing, and improving step by step. 🚀

📚 What You'll Find Here

Small scripts and code examples

Learning exercises

Random experiments with Python syntax, functions, and modules

⚠️ Disclaimer

Please note that:

This code is mainly for learning purposes.

It may not follow best practices (yet!), but I'm working on it. 🙂

Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!

💡 Why This Repo?

I'm using this space to:

Track my progress

Practice writing and organizing code

Share my journey learning Python with others
